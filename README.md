# RandomizeWindowSize4chromium

This is an extension for Chromium and derived web browsers (Chrome, Edge, ...) that gives you a menu button to change the size of the browser window at random with one click, by an amount of +/- 12px.

### Rationale

Many websites try to track their user's behaviour. The most common way to achieve that are cookies. However, when a user simply deletes their cookies, websites and other trackers sometimes resort to identification by browser window size plus IP address.

So, if you want a website to not recognize you from your last visit, just wait a day for your IP address to change, wipe your browser's cookie storage and use this browser extension to randomly change your windows size by a small amount.
